# Dining Philosophers Problem
The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science that was introduced by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965. It demonstrates the challenges of coordinating multiple processes or threads in a concurrent system.

# Problem Description
In this problem, there are five philosophers sitting at a round table. <br>
Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating. <br> 
A fork is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers, and to eat, a philosopher needs to pick up both forks on their sides. <br>

The challenge is to design a solution that prevents deadlocks and ensures that each philosopher gets a fair opportunity to eat without causing resource conflicts.
